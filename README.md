👋 Hello, I'm Asomiddin!

I'm a passionate Python enthusiast diving deep into the world of backend development. Based on our previous conversations, I've crafted this README to reflect your interests, current learning journey, and aspirations.

👀 Interests





Python Programming: I love exploring Python's versatility, from solving algorithmic problems like Fibonacci sequences to building robust backend systems.



Backend Development: I'm fascinated by creating scalable APIs, working with databases, and mastering frameworks like Django and Flask.



Cybersecurity: I'm curious about securing applications and exploring tools like TryHackMe to understand network and system vulnerabilities.



AI and Machine Learning: I'm intrigued by how Python powers AI-driven solutions and its applications in modern tech.



System Administration: I enjoy tinkering with Linux distributions (like Ubuntu and Arch Linux) for development environments and dual-boot setups.

🌱 Currently Learning





Python Backend Development: I'm actively learning to build REST APIs, work with databases (SQL), and deploy applications using frameworks like Django and Flask. My goal is to become a proficient backend developer in 6-18 months, as discussed previously.



Data Structures and Algorithms: I'm practicing Python problems, including loops, conditionals, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, to strengthen my coding skills.



Cloud Computing: I'm exploring cloud technologies and their environmental benefits, like energy efficiency and resource optimization.



Networking: I'm diving into concepts like OSI models, SDN, and CDN to understand how data flows in modern systems.

💞️ Looking to Collaborate On





Open-source Python projects, especially those focused on backend development or API creation.



Cybersecurity challenges or hackathons (e.g., TryHackMe or CTF events).



Real-time web applications using Python frameworks or Node.js for cross-learning.



Educational content creation, such as tutorials or problem-solving guides for Python beginners.
